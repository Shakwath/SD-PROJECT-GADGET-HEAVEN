 #List of React Fundamental concepts used in the project
 JSX: JavaScript XML, the syntax extension for JavaScript, used for describing what the UI should look like.

Components:

Functional Components: Stateless, lightweight functions that return JSX, often with hooks for state and lifecycle.
Class Components: Older React components with more built-in lifecycle methods and state management.
Props: Short for "properties," props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component.

State: A component’s local memory that holds data, managed using useState in functional components.

Event Handling: React’s synthetic events for handling user interactions, like onClick, onChange, etc.

Hooks:

useState: For managing component-level state.
useEffect: For side effects like fetching data or setting up subscriptions.
useContext: For accessing data from the Context API.
useReducer: For more complex state management, often in place of Redux for simpler applications.
Custom Hooks: To reuse logic across components.
Conditional Rendering: Techniques like if statements, the ternary operator, and && to render components conditionally.

Lists and Keys: Rendering lists using .map() and providing unique keys for each item for optimal rendering.etc

 #usedfor handling and managing data (context
 API/local storage)
 Context API:

Use it for state management within your React components.
Great for passing data through the component tree without manually drilling props at every level.
Ideal for temporary data that should update in real-time, like user session data, theme settings, or small app states.
Local Storage:

Useful for persisting data on the client side, even after page refreshes.
Ideal for settings or data that should remain available across sessions, like user preferences, shopping cart items, or authentication tokens.
Be cautious with sensitive data, as local storage isn't encrypted.
