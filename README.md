 <h2>List of React Fundamental concepts used in the project</h2>
 <br />
  01- JSX: JavaScript XML, the syntax extension for JavaScript, used for describing what the UI should look like.<br />
  <h3>Components:</h3>
  <br />
  i- <b>Functional Components:</b> Stateless, lightweight functions that return JSX, often with hooks for state and lifecycle.<br />
  ii- <b>Class Components:</b> Older React components with more built-in lifecycle methods and state management.<br />
  iii-<b>Props:</b> Short for "properties," props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component.<br />
  iv- <b>State: </b>A component’s local memory that holds data, managed using useState in functional components.<br />
   v -<b>Event Handling:</b> React’s synthetic events for handling user interactions, like onClick, onChange, etc.<br />

Hooks:
<br />
useState: For managing component-level state.<br />
useEffect: For side effects like fetching data or setting up subscriptions.<br />
useContext: For accessing data from the Context API.<br />
useReducer: For more complex state management, often in place of Redux for simpler applications.<br />
Custom Hooks: To reuse logic across components.<br />
Conditional Rendering: Techniques like if statements, the ternary operator, and && to render components conditionally.<br />
Lists and Keys: Rendering lists using .map() and providing unique keys for each item for optimal rendering.etc<br />

 <h2>used for handling and managing data (context
 API/local storage)</h2>
    <br />
    <b>Context API:</b>
    Use it for state management within your React components.<br />
    Great for passing data through the component tree without manually drilling props at every level.<br />
    Ideal for temporary data that should update in real-time, like user session data, theme settings, or small app states.<br />
    <b>Local Storage:</b>
    <br />
    Useful for persisting data on the client side, even after page refreshes.<br />
    Ideal for settings or data that should remain available across sessions, like user preferences, shopping cart items, or authentication tokens.<br />
    Be cautious with sensitive data, as local storage isn't encrypted.<br />
